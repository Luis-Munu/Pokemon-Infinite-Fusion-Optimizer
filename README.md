# Pokemon-Infinite-Fusion-Optimizer
A fusion optimizer created for the game Pokemon Infinite Fusion

The program finds the most performant fusion for your needs, based on stats and typing.

There are several parameters the user can toy with, from filtering pokemon by name and total stats, to boosting certain types both offensively and defensively.

The user can also create profiles and adjust the weights of each stat along with the importance of typing to refine the search.

Abilities and movesets are currently ignored and there are no plans to introduce them any time soon.
