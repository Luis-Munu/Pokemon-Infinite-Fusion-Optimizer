# Pokemon Infinite Fusion Optimizer
A fusion optimizer created for the game Pokemon Infinite Fusion

Program created to simplify the process of finding the best fusion for a role, it lets you weight the stats, filter by name, total base stat, find the best partner for a pokemon and even adjust the importance of the typing, both offensively and defensively.

You can also give more weight to specific types, rewarding crucial resistances or STABS such as fighting or ground in comparison to others such as bug. :)

Abilities and movesets are currently ignored and there are no plans to introduce them any time soon.
